        "The paper concludes that energy landscape engineering in quasi-2D halide perovskites is a highly effective strategy for enhancing light emission efficiency, particularly in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). By tailoring the energy landscape within these materials, the researchers were able to funnel energy into low-bandgap domains, significantly improving radiative recombination and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) at low excitation intensities. The study demonstrates that these engineered perovskites can achieve high external quantum efficiencies (EQE) and luminance at lower power densities, making them suitable for practical optoelectronic applications such as low-power, high-brightness LEDs. The findings establish energy landscape engineering as a promising approach for overcoming the limitations of traditional perovskite materials, paving the way for the development of more efficient, stable, and commercially viable perovskite-based devices."
